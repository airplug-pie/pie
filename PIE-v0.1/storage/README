PIE - Storage interface
------------------------

Just source storage_api.tcl in tclsh interpreter. PIE's Storage created four list
(available, forwarded, subscribed and forgotten) to manage streams of the system.
A stream is defined by a couple of information : a car_id and a user's nickanme,
those field shouldn't be changed after stream creation. 

Storage api offers a high level interface to manage stream, it allow to create
new stream, to search existing streams in the differents lists of the system, 
to remove stream from a list or from the whole system, etc ....

See storage_api.tcl's header file for more information about storage system,
and storage_{user,stream,list}.tcl headers files for more specific informations
about user, stream and list interface.
