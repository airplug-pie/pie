Startup
-------

At startup PIE GUI look for configuration under $HOME.

Configuration
--------------

You can use directory 'pie' under share/config, rename
and put it under $HOME/.pie/, at startup if PIE can't
find this directory it will be created and ask you to
define a valid user profile.


There  is  two files, first is global.conf  which are
defined  global settings  of  PIE  application  (what
tabs open at startup, default mode, default user pro-
file). All fields are  optionals, line with a comment
start with '#' and unknown fields will be ignored.

Second file is a user profile configuration, the file
format is NICKNAME.conf, it is  possible to have many
user profiles, PIE  ask you to choose one at startup.
If only one is available then PIE will use it.


Requirement 
------------

It only need to include gui/gui-init.tcl in top level
tcl/tk file to load GUI, GUI load its own required files
as storage, display fonctions, etc .....
