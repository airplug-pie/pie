			--- PIE CONFIGURATION ---

You can use directory 'pie' in this directory, rename
and put it under $HOME/.pie/, at startup if PIE can't
find this directory it will be created and ask you to
define a valid user profile.


There  is  two files, first is global.conf  which are 
defined  global settings  of  PIE  application  (what 
tabs open at startup, default mode, default user pro-
file). All fields are  optionals, line with a comment
start with '#' and unknown fields will be ignored.

Second file is a user profile configuration, the file
format is NICKNAME.conf, it is  possible to have many
user profiles, PIE  ask you to choose one at startup.
If only one is available then PIE will use it.
